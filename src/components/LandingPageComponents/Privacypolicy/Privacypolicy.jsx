    <h2>2. Methods of Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    We utilize technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and other tracking methods to collect the data mentioned above. 
    Some of these tools allow you to opt out of the data collection process.
  </p>

  <h3>2.1 Tracking Technologies and Data Gathering Tools</h3>
  <p>
   We use cookies, which are small text files that your browser saves, to gather, store, and share information about your actions across websites, including on Nextinterview.

    <strong>Nextinterview</strong>, along with third-party service providers (such as Google Analytics and advertisers), employs server logs and 
    automated data gathering methods like cookies, tags, scripts, unique links, device or browser identifiers, and web beacons 
    (collectively referred to as “Data Collection Tools”) to collect data when you interact with the Services. These tools automatically 
    capture specific system and usage data (as outlined in Section 1) while you navigate the platform. In some instances, we may 
    combine the data from these tools with other information we gather as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Purpose of Using Tracking Technologies</h3>
  <p>Nextinterview utilizes the following categories of tracking technologies for the purposes outlined:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Essential:</strong> These tracking tools are necessary for you to access the website and its core features, such as 
      logging in, viewing content, ensuring site security, preventing fraudulent logins, and detecting misuse or unauthorized activity. 
      They are crucial for the proper functioning of the Services, and disabling them may cause certain parts of the site to malfunction 
      or become inaccessible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Preference:</strong> These tools store information about your browser and personal preferences, enhance site functionality, 
      and customize content to suit your needs. They also remember settings related to the appearance and behavior of the Services, 
      like your chosen language or video volume settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Performance Analytics:</strong> These tracking tools assist in assessing and improving the Services by collecting data on 
      usage, performance, page visits, traffic sources, and app download origins. They allow us to test various versions of the platform 
      to identify user preferences and determine the effectiveness of email campaigns.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advertising:</strong> These tools are used to display targeted ads (on our site and others) based on your usage data, device 
      information, and details gathered by ad service providers. The ads are tailored to your recent activity or behaviour across other 
      websites and platforms. We may share a hashed, anonymized version of your email address and any public content you share 
      with advertisers to help deliver personalized ads.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Social Media Integration:</strong> These tools enable social media features, such as sharing content with your connections. 
      They may also track user activity across other sites to build a profile for targeted advertising.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You have the option to configure your browser to notify you when cookies are about to be placed, restrict certain types of cookies, 
    or block them entirely. However, this may affect your ability to use certain features of the Services, leading to a less optimal 
    experience. For more details on managing data collection preferences, see Section 6.1
